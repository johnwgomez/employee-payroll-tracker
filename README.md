## Description 

The Employee Payroll Tracker is a web application designed to help payroll managers view and manage employee payroll data. 

My task was to create 3 major upgrades to the application:

1. Collect employees:
* First  name 
* Last name
* Salary

2. Display their Average Salary

3. Random Pick a Employee


This application __**NOW**__ allows users to add employees, view information, calculate the average salary, and randomly select an employee for reward.

## Installation 

- Clone: git clone git@github.com:johnwgomez/employee-payroll-tracker.git
- cd employee-payroll-tracker

## Usage

1. Open the index.html file in your web browser
2. Click on the “Add Employees” button.

4. After adding employees, the application will:
    * Display the employee data in a table
    * Calculate the average salary
    * Randomly select an employee for recognition
